Scrapes jobs based off of the specific company site I give it and sends me the job title and the link to apply in an email. 

Note: 
      Due to private information from my gmail app password and different emails used. 
      I decided to omit my config.py file which holds app_password (gmail app passowrd to allow scripts to send email) , gmail_user (from_email), recipient_email (to_email)
      Also does not differentiate between old listings that are still up..

This project utilizes Selenium Webdriver and Python 3.9.
More scripts are to come for other companies.
